A RESTful Web API built with ASP.NET Core 8 that handles user data operations including Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD).
This project demonstrates key backend development practices such as:

Layered architecture (Controller, Service, Data layers)

Entity Framework Core with In-Memory Database

Dependency Injection

RESTful routing and status codes

The goal is to provide a clean and scalable foundation for user management systems, and to prepare for adding authentication (JWT), authorization, and role-based access control in later stages
